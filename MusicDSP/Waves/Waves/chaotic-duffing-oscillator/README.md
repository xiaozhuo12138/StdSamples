## Chaotic-Duffing-Oscillator

<dl>
  <dt>About</dt>
  <dd>This project aims to demonstrate a nonlinear (chaotic) dynamic system by an application of Duffing Osillator (Equation). This chaotic structural model poses a chaotic behavior for a set of defined parameters and initial conditions, and to approximate the dynamics of the system, a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method will be applied to solve the problem.</dd>

  <dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>The chaotic behavior in motion is not unusual to observe in practice in common nonlinear differential equations. Through close examination of nonlinear dynamics of a system governed by a Duffingâ€™s Equation, one can observe how phase-space motion follows a strange attractor as harmonic excitations are applied to the system. A Duffing oscillator system of complexity as simple as a second-order ordinary differential equation exhibits bifurcation past some threshold value of excitation due to periodic doubling, bounded by five parameters and initial conditions. Through visual aids and graphical responses, the chaotic motion of a Duffing system (i.e. spring) is observed, and verified in simple visualization techniques in Python.</dd>

  <dt>Duffing Oscillator</dt>
  <dd>Duffing Oscillator(Equation) is a (nonlinear) system that is often periodically forced and damped with some nonlinear elasticity associated. The governing equation is as follows:

  <dt>Methods Used</dt>
  <dd>Runge-Kutta Algorithm (4th order)
    - widely used numerical method for differential equations, by interpolating derivatives at half-way points and taking a weighted average with the step size into account</dd>
  <dd>Harmonic Balance Method
    - most commonly used method in studying the steady-state frequency response in a nonlinear dynamical system (autonomous and non-autonomous). By assumed the response in terms of a Fourier series in the differential equation and separating the harmonic coefficients, the frequency amplitude and the unknown coefficients in the response relation of the system can be determined (assuming the response to be in form of a sinusoid).</dd>
