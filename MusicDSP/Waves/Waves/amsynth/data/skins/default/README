                         SKINNING AMSYNTH

amsynth's GUI is now (almost) completely data-driven, so it is possible to
change the layout and appearance of the synth controls (knobs and buttons)
based on a skin-file.

A skin file is simply a zip file that contains:
 * layout.ini - lists the position of and images used for each control
 * a collection of bitmap resources, referenced by layout.ini

The names of the controls are hard-coded into amsynth.

To run amsynth with a different skin, use the AMSYNTH_SKIN environment
variable to specify the path of the skin. The path can either be a skin zip
file, or a directory containing the contents of a skin zip. By using a skin
directory you can quickly test changes without having to re-zip all the
resources :-)

e.g.

  AMSYNTH_SKIN=~/skin-2 amSynth

Will instruct amsynth to use the skin in the directory ~/skin-2


Have a look at the default skin to get a feel for the layout.ini format and
see how frames are stitched together. Have fun ;-)
