#
#	MIDI Configuration
#

# select MIDI driver to use [ auto / alsa / oss ]
# the ALSA driver uses the sequencer client interface. you will have to
# 'aconnect' it to something to get input.

midi_driver 		auto

# set the OSS compatible MIDI device file to read input data from.
# eg /dev/midi or /dev/midi00 for some systems.

oss_midi_device		/dev/midi

# MIDI channel to listen for events on. MIDI channels are numbered 1-16,
# setting midi_channel to 0 means listen on all channels. MIDI output is
# sent on this channel (or channel 1 if midi_channel is 0.)

midi_channel		0


#
#	AUDIO Output Configuration
#

# select audio driver to use. (auto/alsa-mmap/alsa/oss/jack)
#
# auto selects the best available driver (in the order jack alsa-mmap alsa oss)
# for most people 'auto' will always be the best choice
#
# 'jack' is the best choice for interoperating with other music programs,
# and typically achieves the lowest latency
#
# 'alsa-mmap' has better performance than 'alsa', but may be less compatible

audio_driver		auto


# set the OSS digital audio device to output to.

oss_audio_device	/dev/dsp

# set the ALSA pcm device to use
# you should probably set this to hw:0 or similar, if you know what youre doing
# when using alsa-mmap for audio out, you will probably need to specify hw:0

alsa_audio_device	default

# sets the sampling rate to use
#
# (this has no effect when using JACK - the jack server decides the sample rate)
#
# lower sampling rates use less CPU power, so more voices are usable at once.

sample_rate		44100


#
#	General Options
#

# sets the default maximum polyphony (simultaneous notes played)
# playing too many motes for your CPU power will do horrible things.
#
# Pentium3 class machines will safely do 16 voices, (pentium4 2.40GHz = 60)
#
# set this to 0 for unlimited polyphony

polyphony		16
