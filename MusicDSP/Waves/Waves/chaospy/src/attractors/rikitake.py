r"""Rikitake chaotic system.

Description :
    Rikitake system is ordinary differential equation (ODE) of
    3rd order system.
    Rikitake system attempts to explain the reversal of the Earthâ€™s
    magnetic field.

    Rikitake equations are:
        dx/dt = -mu * x + z * y
        dy/dt = -mu * y + x * (z - a)
        dz/dt = 1 - x * y

    where a, mu - are Rikitake system parameters.
    Default values are
        - a = 5,
        - mu = 2
        or

        - a = mu = 1.
