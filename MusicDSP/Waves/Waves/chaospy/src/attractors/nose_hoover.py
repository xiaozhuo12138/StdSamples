r"""Nose-Hoover attractor system.

Description:
    The Nose–Hoover thermostat is a deterministic algorithm for
    constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. It was originally
    developed by Nose and was improved further by Hoover.

    Nose–Hoover oscillator is ordinary differential equation (ODE) of
    3rd order system.
    Nose–Hoover system has only five terms and two quadratic
    nonlinearities.

    Nose–Hoover equations are:
        dx/dt = y
        dy/dt = y * z - x
        dz/dt = 1 - y * y

    Nose–Hoover system doesn't have any system parameters.
