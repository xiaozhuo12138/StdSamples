------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2003-12-01   Where have I been?
             Clean up the wavedata generation code
             Too many structures, too complicated

             Karplus-Strong (pluck) oscillator would
             be nice, plus some variants (different
             filters etc)

2003-08-27   Replace malloced data structures with
             static data where possible

             Create arpeggiator and combined BL osc
             with phase sync

             gettext support                             2003-09-09

2003-01-29   Create gentoo .ebuild for v0.2.6            2003-01-29    0.2.6

2003-01-25   Create rdf file to describe plugins         2003-01-29    0.2.6

2003-01-15   Check recent changes re: performance, and   2003-01-25    0.2.6
             release 0.2.6. It's been faaaar too long

2002-12-17   See what can be done to make the            2002-12-23    0.2.6
             oscillator code branchless

2002-11-24   The low pass filter - tune it, sigmoid it   2002-12-17    0.2.6
             and FINISH it. Dammit :)

2002-09-18   Where have I been? Erm....                  2002-11-24    0.2.6
             Need an ADSR with Gate+Trigger

2002-07-10   Rework the lowpass filter plugin that       2002-07-14    0.2.5
             comes with ladspaToy - make it stable and
             add an audio port variant.

2002-06-17   ADSR, Control-to-Audio interpolator and     2002-06-25    0.2.4
             Randomizer plugins

             Get IDs for new plugins                     2002-06-25    0.2.4

             Add make rules for new plugins              2002-06-25    0.2.4

2002-06-07   Square waves only contain odd harmonics     2002-06-08    0.2.0
             - need to fix wavegen and co to handle
             this properly (at present, some
             wavetables have extra sample data
             containing 0 harmonics).

2002-06-04   NONSENSE REMOVED                            2002-06-04    0.2.0

             Triangle plugin still producing the odd     2002-06-05    0.2.0
             NaN - need to really test it properly

2002-05-31   triangle.so.c - Why is it really loud       2002-06-01    0.2.0
             (compared to sawtooth)?

2002-05-29   Interpolate.h - getSamples: This function   2002-06-01    0.2.0
             needs urgent attention. All those %'s.
             Find a way of cleaning it up.

             getTable: Cross fading should not be        2002-06-02    0.2.0
             done at the two extreme frequencies
             (below minimum or above maximum). And no
             output should result from very high
             frequencies.

2002-05-23   Optimisation - there are definitely a
             couple of ways of reducing the number of
             interpolations done per sample:

               1) For the pulse and triangle, if the     DISCARDED
                  pulsewidth/slope is kept to a whole    (2002-06-02)
                  number phase offset (so that the
                  interpolation interval is the same
                  for both the in-phase and shifted
                  waveforms), it is possible to do
                  the difference (to get the pulse),
                  and then do a single interpolation
                  on the result.

               2) For cross fading, it is slightly       2002-05-28    0.1.3
                  more difficult, as each wave has a
                  different number of samples (so the
                  interval is different for each,
                  requiring two interpolations). This
                  can be overcome by generating pairs
                  of wavetables of the same sample
                  count for cross fading, at the cost
                  of doubling the memory used for the
                  wavedata.

2002-05-15   Stress tests (make sure there are no        2002-06-14    0.2.3
             crashes etc. for extreme values)

2002-05-12   Build System - Use Auto{make,conf}          2002-07-10    0.2.4

             Resampling interpolation  - it's linear     2002-05-15    0.1.2
             at the moment, which works, but is a bit
             crap. Try cubic spline interp.

             Mixing of two wavetables: Should be
             logarithmic, not linear proportions.

             See if there's a better way to do           2002-05-23   0.1.2
             wavetable lookups than the binary tree.
             All those float comparisons will take
             their toll...
