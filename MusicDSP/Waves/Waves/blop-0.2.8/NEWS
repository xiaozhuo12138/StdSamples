Jan-29-2003: Now with RDF metadata
Jan-25-2003: Improved performance of bandlimited oscillators
              (between 16% and 89% faster)
             Low pass filter now comes in two variants - a fast
              roughly tuned one, and a new slower accurately 
              tuned variant.
Jan-09-2003: New sequencer, sync square and gate+trigger ADSR
             Major fixes to oscillator code (removed branches)
              and properly tuned low pass filter.
Jul-14-2002: New low-pass resonant filter plugin
Jul-10-2002: Now with configure and autostuff
Jul-08-2002: A couple of new plugins (sum, which was lmod, and
              product).
Jul-06-2002: Finalised GNU build system - confirmed as functional
Jun-19-2002: A few more new plugins: random wave, adsr and
              control-to-audio interpolator
Jun-17-2002: New plugins added: amp, fmod and lmod
             Oh, and the first page on the website is up...

Jun-14-2002: Fixed extreme frequency bug that was causing
              phase drift. Now ignores frequencies exceeding
              [-Nyquist,+Nyquist] - no phase advance.
Jun-09-2002: Fixed Gibbs compensation - now works properly.
Jun-01-2002: Bugfix: Parabola generation code was using
              the wrong scale factor, causing triangle
              plugin to have excessive amplitude. Now matches
              other plugins.
May-31-2002: Some optimisations mean they now run faster
             Now really do use cubic spline interpolation
              (previously 5th order)
May-15-2002: Now does cubic spline interpolation.
