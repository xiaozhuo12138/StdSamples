Generic installation instructions can be found in the file named INSTALL.

Briefly, it's just:

$ ./configure
$ make

and

$ make install

to install the plugins.

It is assumed that the LADSPA SDK is installed under /usr - you can change
this by supplying the path to configure using --with-ladspa-prefix.

If you want the plugins to be installed somewhere in particular, use the
--with-ladspa-plugin-dir option (make sure that the path supplied is in your
$LADSPA_PATH!)

If you want smaller wavedata, use the --enable-small-wavedata option. This
trades off accuracy against size. It still sounds good though...

Finally, if you already have plugins with the same name as any of the blop
plugins, you can use --program-prefix=blop_ (or something else) to ensure
the existing ones are not overwritten. Alternatively, just put them in a new
directory....

If you have installed liblrdf, there is an rdf metadata file: doc/blop.rdf - copy
this to wherever you keep your rdf's

Building from CVS:

Versions:
autoconf 2.58
automake 1.5
gettext 0.12.1

After initial checkout, you need to run gettextize to set up symlinks to installed
gettext bits and pieces:

$ gettextize -f --no-changelog

You'll then need to prepare the build cruft:

$ aclocal -I m4
$ autoheader
$ autoconf
$ automake -a
