# AudioLAB-LuaJIT
AudioDSP

# Lua
* It is the simplest language possible to swig
* It is minimal and easy langauge to use
* It is perfect for specific purposes like audio/midi

# VCV Rack
* Want it to be able to script modules easily
* Create the Lua AudioDSP sound graph 
* Run it in VCV Rack like the experimenter board

# Raspberry/Arduino
* Want to make it work on the PutinPi and Duino

# Differentiable AudioDSP
* All the AudioDSP is in here
* Lua scripts are like classes
* You have a Tick function
* You can get and set properties
* All the signal graph logic is easy to define in Lua

# Swig
* Because Lua is the easiet it is easier to embed it in other languages
* Thus, it is now become a bridge language
* To make bridges between things with little lua logics
