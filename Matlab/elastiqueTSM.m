%
% elastiqueTSM is a wrapper function which calls a online version of the
% proprietary TSM algorithm "elastique". For further information about the
% algorithm visit http://www.zplane.de/index.php?page=description-elastique
% and for further information about the API see the elastique_doku-folder
% at http://www.sonicapi.com.
%
% In order to be able to use the online service, you need a valid
% Access-Id which you can get by signing up at http://www.sonicapi.com.
% Afterwards you can insert your id in the code below.
%
% In addition you need the command-line tool cURL to transmit data in the
% network and here to upload your file to the server. cURL should be
% installed on every UNIX-based system. For Windows users, the curl.exe
% must be located inside the TSM Toolbox folder (we use it in version
% 7.33.0, 32bit).
% To Download cURL visit http://curl.haxx.se/download.html.
%
% Input:  x                 input signal.
%         s                 constant scaling factor. Due to limitations of
%                           the online service it needs to be in the range
%                           [0.25 .. 4]
%
%         parameter.
%             pitchShift    additionally also pitch shifts the signal by
%                           [-24 .. 24] semitones.
%             formantShift  additionally also pitch shifts the formants of
%                           by [-12 .. 12] semitones.
%             fsAudio       the sampling rate of the input audio signal x.
%
%
% Output: y                 the time-scale modified output signal.
