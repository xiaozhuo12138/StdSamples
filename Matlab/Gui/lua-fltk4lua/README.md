#         fltk4lua -- Lua Binding to the Fast Light Tool Kit         #

##                           Introduction                           ##

[FLTK][1] is a small C++ GUI toolkit portable to the MS Windows,
Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems. **fltk4lua** is a binding to
this C++ toolkit, which allows you to create GUIs from within Lua
scripts.

##                           Documentation                          ##

There is a small [Getting Started tutorial][2] with some step by step
instructions to building a GUI with **fltk4lua**, and a list of
available userdata types, functions, and properties, as well as some
information about building this module in the `doc` subdirectory (and
on the [GitHub wiki][3]). Other than that you will have to use the
[official FLTK documentation][4] (fortunately the Lua API is very
close to the C++ API), and look at the examples or the source code.
