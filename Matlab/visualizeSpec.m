%
% Visualizes a waveform.
%
% Input:    spec             spectrogram.
%           parameter.
%               fAxis        frequency axis of the spectrogram.
%               tAxis        timeAxis of the spectrogram.
%               logComp      factor for logarithmic compression of the data
%                            for a clearer visualization.
%               visFreqRange frequency range that should be visualized.
