% Computes the short-time Fourier transform (stft) of the input audio
% signal.

% Input:    x               single-channel signal.
%           parameter.
%               anaHop      either the constant hop size of the analysis
%                           window or a vector of analysis positions in the
%                           input signal.
%               win         the analysis window used for windowing the
%                           input signal.
%               zeroPad     number of zeros that should be padded to the
%                           window to increase the fft size and therefore
%                           the frequency resolution.
%               fsAudio     the sampling rate of the input audio signal x.
%               numOfFrames can be set to fix the number of spectra that
%                           should be computed.
%               fftShift    can be set to 1 to apply a circular shift of
%                           samples to each frame by half its length prior
%                           to the application of the fft.

% Output:   spec            complex spectrogram
%           f               vector of the center frequencies of all Fourier
%                           bins given in Hertz.
%           t               vector specifying the time instances in seconds
%                           where the respective Fourier spectra were
%                           computed.
