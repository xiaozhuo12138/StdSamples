% Pitch modification via time-scale modification. The input signal is first
% stretched and resampled afterwards to achieve the pitch modification
% effect.
%
% Input:    x               input signal.
%           n               amount of pitch shifting that should be applied
%                           to the signal given in cents. Positive numbers
%                           indicate an upwards pitch shift, negative
%                           numbers a downwards pitch shift.
%           parameter.
%               fsAudio     the sampling rate of the input audio signal x.
%               algTSM      handle to the time-scale modification algorithm
%                           that should be used to stretch the signal prior
%                           to the resampling.
%
% Output:   y               the pitch modified output signal.
