% Seperates a given audio signal into a harmonic and a percussive component
% according to the paper "Harmonic/Percussive Separation using Median
% Filtering" by Fitzgerald.
%
% Input:  x                 input signal.
%         parameter.
%          anaHop           the stft hop size of the analysis window.
%          win              the stft analysis window used for windowing the
%                           input signal.
%          zeroPad          number of zeros that should be padded to the
%                           window to increase the fft size and therefore
%                           the frequency resolution.
%          filLenHarm       length of the median filter in time direction.
%          filLenPerc       length of the median filter in frequency
%                           direction.
%          maskingMode      either 'binary' or 'relative'. Specifies if a
%                           binary or a relative weighting mask should be
%                           applied to the spectrogram to perform the
%                           separation.
%
% Output: xHarm             the harmonic component of the input signal x.
%         xPerc             the percussive component of the input signal x.
