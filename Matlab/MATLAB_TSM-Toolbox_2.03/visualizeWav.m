% Visualizes a waveform.
%
% Input:    x               single-channel signal.
%           parameter.
%               fsAudio     the sampling rate of the audio signal x.
%               ampRange    maximal and minimal amplitude value.
%               timeRange   can be set to visualize just a specific time
%                           frame of the signal (given in seconds).
%               title       optional title of the figure.
