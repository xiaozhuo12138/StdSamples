%
% Computing the 'inverse' of the stft according to the paper "Signal
% Estimation from Modified Short-Time Fourier Transform" by Griffin and
% Lim.
%
% Input:   spec             a complex spectrogram generated by stft.
%          parameter.
%             synHop        hop size of the synthesis window.
%             win           the synthesis window.
%             zeroPad       number of zeros that were padded to the
%                           window to increase the fft size and therefore
%                           the frequency resolution.
%             numOfIter     number of iterations the algorithm should
%                           perform to adapt the phase.
%             origSigLen    original length of the audio signal such that
%                           the output can be trimmed accordingly.
%             restoreEnergy when windowing the synthesis frames, there is a
%                           potential for some energy loss. This option
%                           will rescale every windowed synthesis frame to
%                           compensate for this energy leakage.
%             fftShift      in case the stft was computed with an fftShift,
%                           setting this parameter to 1 will compensate for
%                           that by applying the same shifting operation
%                           again to each frame after the ifft.
%
% Output:  y                the time-domain signal.
