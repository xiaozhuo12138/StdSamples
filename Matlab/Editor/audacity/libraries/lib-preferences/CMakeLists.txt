#[[
Classes managing settings that persist between runs of the program.

Settings objects for various types (boolean, numbers, strings, enumerations)
that package a preference key path and a default value (so that literals are
not duplicated in widely separated parts) and cache values in memory.

PreferenceListener which is a callback notified of certain changes of
preferences.

PreferenceInitializer is a callback for the reinitialization of preferences.

FileConfig decorates wxFileConfig, with a member function to
alert the user of failure to initialize it (as when the file is read-only).
