Things I would like to do sooner or later:

UI stuff:

* Be able to do some stuff with only one channel (select, play, copy)
* Display mouse pointer position.
* Song split function
* Command to suspend the current session and exit. The whole session
  (windows, tempfiles, history, clipboard, marks, selections etc)
  could then be recalled another time.
  * Integrate with the LASH session handling system.
  * Journalling so a session can be recovered fully after a crash. 
* Do the I/O for the view with async IO or thread.
* Logarithmic (dB) peak display. 
* Amplitude scale
* Preview function in effect browser
* Clip information dialog box
* Dialog for managing marks
* Create marks from selection endpoints
* Reset button for speed/zoom sliders.
* Tabbed windows with more than one file.

Editing:
* Make the insert silence function click-free (keeping the same amplitude
  as the surrounding sound)
* Shaped dithering
* Copy/paste between mhwaveedit instances
  * Copy/paste to and from other audio applications
* Create and edit curves and use them for effect parameters.
* Remove DC component and center waveform functions.
* Synchronizing/aligning files
* Apply effects one time for each channel

Playback/recording:

* Option to record until silence.
* Full duplex sound drivers.
  * Recording in sync with playback.
  * Recording anytime without stopping playback.
* Separating input and output driver where possible.
* Show remaining possible recording time while recording.
* Do recording in completely separate thread/process
* Place cursor exactly where we stopped on low-latency sound drivers.
* Record a few seconds "ahead" so you can start recording a bit too
  late without missing anything.
* Change the start/endpoint of a loop in real-time as the selection 
  changes.

File formats:

* Keeping the compressed data as much as possible when editing mp3/ogg
* Remember mp3/ogg metadata (artist, title etc)
* A better export function.
* Store marks and loop points in file.

Other:

* Add more accelerator keys and make sure they don't clash.
