Quality

Some notes on sound quality.

The general rule when doing audio editing/processing is to not manipulate the data more than necessary and keep an original copy whenever you're processing your important files. 

Cut, copy and paste operations move the data around without modifying it, so these don't degrade the sound quality. Because of level differences, you may get a "step" at the start and end of the inserted part, which can cause a small clicking sound. 

The mix paste function doesn't decrease quality, unless the peaks become too high and you get clipping. In that case you will get a warning message.

Sound data is normally stored as integer values. Therefore, whenever you normalize, adjust volume, decrease sample size or filter a sound, the result must be rounded. If you use 24 or 32 bit sample sizes, this is not really a problem, but if you use 8 or 16 bits sample size, this rounding causes a decrease in quality. 

The quality decrease that the rounding causes can be masked by adding a small amount of noise before rounding. This is called "dithering". mhWaveEdit supports basic dithering and it's enabled by default.

By default, mhWaveEdit uses floating-point temporary files for storing processed results to avoid rounding until the file is saved.
