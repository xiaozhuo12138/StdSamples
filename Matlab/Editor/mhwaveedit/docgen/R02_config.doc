Configure options

For most people, just using ./configure without any arguments should work fine, but here are some options that the configure-script supports:

--disable-gtk2

  If you have both GTK+ 1.2 and GTK+ 2.0 installed and want to use GTK+ 1.2, 
  specify this option.

--without-portaudio 
--without-sdl
--without-alsalib
--without-oss
--without-jack
  
  Specifying this option will leave out a sound driver, even if 
  it's libs and headers are found.

--without-libsndfile
--without-libsamplerate

  Specifying this option will leave out libsndfile/libsamplerate 
  support, even if the library is found.

--with-libsndfile=prefix
--with-libsamplerate=prefix

  This lets you specify the prefix where libsndfile/libsamplerate is 
  installed if it wasn't auto-detected.

--with-double-samples

  Use double precision floating point numbers for sample processing. If
  you intend to edit 32-bit files, you should enable this. 
  
--without-check-casts

  This option disables the run-time type cast checking. It makes some parts of
  the program faster, but makes it harder to debug.
