Known bugs in mhWaveEdit:

* When stopping, the cursor doesn't stop exactly where the playback stopped.
 
* Not highly tested on big-endian systems. Feedback on this is welcome. 

* The ALSA driver sometimes underrun shortly after playback started or 
  cursor jump, causing a click in the playback. 

* When using the EsounD driver and other programs are playing as well,
  the cursor position can become delayed.

* Doesn't work properly with Lame version 3.92 and older.

* Can crash when using GTK+ 1.2 and built with aRts driver, due to 
  linking with both glib 1.2 and 2.x at the same time.
