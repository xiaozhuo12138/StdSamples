% Input:    anchorpoints    an n x 2 matrix specifying a set of
%                           anchorpoints. An anchorpoint is a pair of
%                           sample positions [l k] which says that sample
%                           position l of the input signal should be
%                           (roughly) mapped to sample position k in the
%                           TSM result.
%           parameter.
%               fsAudio     the sampling rate of the audio signal x.
