# CoreDSP

# You will not understand this really
* If you are even out there
* I can not see your or know you are there
* You can not communicate in this pipe except with emoticons and astral internet memetic projection art

# It has all the core DSP functions
* Some of it is now in the std::dsp
* I make alot of it
* Other people make stuff in it
* If I do not know how to do something I use artificial intelligence to deeply search github
* Then, I find examples and prototypes of the kind of thing I wish to do with it

# It is a chatbot in Visual Code now
* You can ask it to program the algorithm for you
* It doesn't really work very well
* It can only program in Python or Javascript
* It is faster to just do it 
* It can not solve anything except triviail for loops and things
* Do not get your hopes up about it yet
* It can only do things that were already easy to do yourself
* It makes sense because that is what a computer was designed to do from the start
* Make it eaiser and much faster to do things you can do yourself
